 <div>This intial project utilized JavaScript to flip between an array of background colors, using rbga, hex, and basic colors when the button Click Me! was selected by the user. The background color, in the form that it was saved within the array is then displayed when the background color changes.</div>

 <div>In this portion of the first project, we used Math.random() to generate a random hex value to display as the background color and listed on the page when the user clicked the  button. </div>

<h2 id="counter-project">Counter Project</h2>
For this project, we designed a Counter, that would increase or decrease the displayed integer depending on which button was clicked. When the counter was reset to zero, the font color will be black, when the number was positive, the font color became green, and negative values are shown with red font color.

The other version for smaller, possibly mobile screens, allowed an icon to be clicked, in which a dropdown menu of links was shown if the user needed the menu.</p>

<h2 id="modal-project"> Modal Project</h2>

<p>This project created modal containers that would become visible or overlay depending on the user selection. The first image is the main page. The second image is when the modal content overlays the main page, with options to return back to the main. The overlay of the modal includes increasing opaqueness of the background image to bring the full focus to the modal content with CSS.</p>

<h2 id="questions-project"> Questions Project</h2>

<p>This project utilized JavaScript to dynamically display often-asked questions and their answers. An array of three questions and their answers are displayed, with some CSS transform animation included in hovering over the plus button to display the text. JavaScript was utilized to remove the display of the text if a different question was selected by the user.</p>

<h2 id="menu-project"> Menu Project</h2>

<p>This larger project generated a menu dynamically depending on the information included in the array of titles, images, prices, and descriptions of different menu items. The user can choose to display the menu in its entirety or can select depending on buttons generated by categories listed in each of the items of the array. JavaScript was then utilized to display the items on the menu without overlap of other items depending on the user's screen size.</P>

<h2 id="video-project"> Video Project</h2>

<p>This project incorporated a different kind of display time, a mp4 background video. To allow the video to go more toward the background in comparison of the title, a dark overlay was applied to the video. Because the overlay then negates the operation of the video controls, using CSS, a small button was then included to pause and restart the video playing in the background. 

A second aspect to this project, was a preloader gif displayed until the window was fully loaded.C</p>

<h2 id="scroll-project"> Scroll Project</h2>

<p>This project included a responsive menu or navbar between a smaller and larger screen as observed in a previous project. Instead of different pages included as links in the navbar, different sections of the page are options. Smooth scrolling between all the elements was also included. To align the sections perfectly, JavaScript was utilized to accom odate for the navbar dynamically. The first image is of the larger screen and shows the alignment of the section header to directly below the navbar. The second image is if the page is viewed through a smaller screen and shows the main page with header.</p>

<p>This project not only utilized JavaScript to create a functional ToDo list, but also incorporated the LocalStorage API that comes with JavaScript to keep items included on the list on the history of the browser. Full CRUD functionality for all items on the grocery list. The following images illustrate the following functions: 1) Adding an item. 2)Confirmation message that the item has been deleted. 3)Confirmation message that the item has been successfully edited and updated within the memory. 4)Using the Application area of Chrome's developer tools, you can select the local storage database and view the key value pairs saved to and referred by the browser.</p>
